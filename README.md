# IPL Match Prediction

## Project Overview
The IPL Match Prediction project leverages data science techniques to analyze and predict the outcomes of IPL matches. This project involves cleaning, processing, and modeling cricket data to identify patterns and insights that impact match results.

## Objectives
1. Predict the winner of IPL matches using machine learning techniques.
2. Analyze the influence of key factors like toss, venue, and player performance.
3. Provide data-driven insights into IPL match trends.

## Features of the Dataset
- **Match Information**: Teams, venue, and match result.
- **Player Performance**: Runs scored, wickets taken, and strike rates.
- **Toss and Decision**: Impact of toss on match outcome.
- **Other Factors**: Weather and pitch conditions.

## Methodology
1. **Data Collection**: Compiled historical IPL match data from reliable sources.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Processed raw data for inconsistencies and missing values.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualized trends and correlations in the data.
4. **Modeling**: Applied machine learning models to predict match outcomes.
5. **Evaluation**: Measured accuracy and improved the models iteratively.

## Key Findings
- Toss decisions have a moderate influence on match results.
- Venue and player performance significantly impact match outcomes.
- Prediction accuracy of the best-performing model is **XX%**.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, sklearn
- **Tools**: Jupyter Notebook
